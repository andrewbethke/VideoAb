        <p>The thumbnail is one of the most important parts of making a YouTube video successful. It is the first part of the video the viewer encounters,
        so it has to count, and it has to beat every other creator who is playing the exact same thumbnail game with their own videos.</p>
        
        <p>The problem is that it can be <em>really</em> hard to know whether or not a thumbnail is, you know, good. And it's not like YouTube helps you to
        select one! Their auto-generated thumbnails are just a frame pulled from the video with one of the site's <em>many</em> mysterious algorithms, and
        their automatic thumbnail AB testing has only rolled out to a handful of creators.</p>

        <p>Enter VideoAb. Simple automatic thumbnail and title AB testing. Just select the video to run the test on, put in your titles and thumbnails, and
        press "Begin Test." Once the test is completed, you can look at your analytics and figure out which of your combinations performed the best. Is it
        as seamless as YouTube's own offering will be? Nope! Not even close! But it's available now, to everybody. No special treatment required.</p>
